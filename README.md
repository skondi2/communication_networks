## MP 1: Application Layer
Simple HTTP Client and Server
- Client performs GET operations to web servers
- Server processes GET operations from web servers 


## MP 2: Transport Layer
TCP
- Implementation that tolerates packet drops, delays, and fair bandwidth distribution



## MP 3: Network Layer
Distant Vector Routing Algorithm and Link State Routing Algorithm
- Uses the DV and LS algorithms to produce a correct forwarding table depending on network topology 



## MP 4: Link Layer
CSMA Protocol Simulation
- Evaluates success of CSMA simulation based on channel utilization percentage
